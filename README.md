## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

This is my flexbox project for cohort 4 in HerTechTrail. This is like the toughest and most tasking project given to us since we started this program.

## The challenge

The challenge is to create a a responsive flexbox that can adjust to any media screen using the guidelines and assets given to us.

## About My Project

This is a flexbox project created from scratch using HTML and CSS on visualstudio code.The flexbox is responsive and can adjust to any media screen size.
All the assets used in the project were given to us by our instructor and can be found in the images folder.

## Building your project

We were asked to fork the project from our instructor's github account to ours and then clone to our local device and create the flexbox inside before pushing it back.
I used the guidelines and assets given to us to create my flexbox project, then i updated my readme file. Finally i initalized my project,added my new files,committed my changes, then pushed the project to my github from gitbash.

## Deploying your project

I deployed my project using github and netify.

## References

I made use of Google and the assets in the images and design folder.

## Conclusion 

Despite the fact that this project was kind of tough and complicated at some point,it was also like my interesting and best project ever.
